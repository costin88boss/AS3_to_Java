This was a failed attempt to make a ActionScript 3 to Java transpiler.
The lexer code is a nightmare to look at, and I should have made an abstract syntax tree instead.

either way, the transpiler idea came because I wanted to make a remake of a flash game, and I thought to myself, what if I just converted all its code to java?
